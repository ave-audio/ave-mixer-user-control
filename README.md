## Releases

### [v2.2.4.7](https://github.com/ave-audio/ave-mixer-user-control/releases/installer/v2.2.4.7) - 2024-06-14
- Fixed and improved the mixer type check to avoid using the software with a mixer different from the one set in the project.
- Modified the save preset command to force the updating of parameters in the DSP in MCU firmware version v1.7.6.
- Improved management of pop-up windows to inform the user. A new pop-up window automatically closes the previous ones and does not pause the communication between PC and mixer.
- Improved communication initialization when changing communication bus from SerialCOM to TCP/IP and vice versa even without closing the project.
- Added the message dispatcher for toast type messages.
- Improved management of toast messages to signal the connection or disconnection between PC and mixer.

### [v2.2.4.6](https://github.com/ave-audio/ave-mixer-user-control/raw/22a0db377b934dd5d6fa486af07069eeaaa9d937/releases/installer/v2.2.4.6/AVE%20Mixer%20User%20Control%20-%20V2.2.4.6.zip) - 2024-05-11
- Create the structures (model and viemodel) relating to the Andante V2.0 mixer.
- Added compressor gain value readout for input and output compressors.
